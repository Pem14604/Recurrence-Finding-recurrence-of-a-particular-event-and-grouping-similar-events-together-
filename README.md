# Problem Statement


Recurrence: Group similar incidents together and find similar incidents of any particular incident.

Modelâ€™s Parameters:
- TopRecSent: This is used to set the threshold value to show top recurred sentences, by default it is set to 100.
- SimilarityPer: This is used to set the threshold value for similarity percentage. By default is it (0.6) which means sentence having similarity more than 60% will be grouped together.
- DateColumn: This is required to prepare the final dataframe.
- IncidentDescription: This is the text column on which we are trying to find the recurrence pattern.

Model Preparation:
Steps:
- 1.	Data Cleaning
- 2.	Sentence Embedding( TFIDF)
- 3.	Cosine Similarity b/w vectors generated by TFIDF (matrix size NxN)
- 4.	Creating new matrix having more than 60% similarity between elements.
- 5.	Dataframe creation having details as below:

# Sentence Text,	Repeated Sentences Index,	Repeated Count

# Studied Approach:
- 6. After 5 steps we are taking whole data having repeated count less than 10.
- 7. Sentence Embedding creation using  TDFIDF.
- 8. Cosine Similarity b/w vectors.
- 9. Creating new matrix having more than 60% similarity between elements.
- 10. Creating data frame as per step 5.
- 11. Taking data having repeated count less than 10 and adding rest in dataframe created in step 5.
- 12. Repeating 6 to 10 steps in loop.

# Final Approach:
- 6.	Sentence Embedding( TFIDF) of above column (Sentence Text)
- 7.	Cosine Similarity b/w vectors generated by TFIDF (matrix size NxN)
- 8.	Creating new matrix having more than 60% similarity between elements.
- 9.	Final dataframe creation having details as below: 

# Sentence Text,	Repeated Sentences Index,	Repeated Count,	Recent Date	 Date
				


# Similarity Search (Prediction):
- 1.	Taking input from user( text data).
- 2.	Creating embedding of input sentence.
- 3.	Cosine similarity b/w input sentence and sentence text of final data frame( step 9).
- 4.	Showing top 3 similar sentence as below format:

# Sentence Text,	Repeated Sentences Index,	Repeated Count,	Recent Date	 Date
